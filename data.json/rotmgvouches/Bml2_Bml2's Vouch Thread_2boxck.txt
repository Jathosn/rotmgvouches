If we've completed a trade, please leave a vouch and little bit of info about the trade.

Previous vouch thread: http://redd.it/23i91j. My previous vouch thread contains 8 vouches, so I'll count from there.

If you have any screenshots as proof, make sure to link those. Also, the only skype I use for trading is "bmll.games". It doesn't hurt to ask me to pm you on reddit before a trade too.

Thanks!
